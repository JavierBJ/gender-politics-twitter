@neuslloveras Hi there. I'm a BBC Radio journalist in Scotland. I'm looking for a pro-independence politician in Catalunya to tell us about the current climate there......at 0945 CET tomorrow morning. Would you be able and willing to help us? chris.wands@bbc.co.uk thanks
@RafaCatalaPolo @Turespana_ I believe that police and AENA delete the CCTV recordings of their wrongdoing and crime evidence to fake that their airports are safe under the best police.
@RafaCatalaPolo @Turespana_ To attract the tourism, why Spain advertise that "Spain is the safest country in Europe" when we were not able to get the police help in the departure area of Valencia airport.
@RafaCatalaPolo @Turespana_ When Spanish police did not respond to my begging for the SOS-help under a lot ofCCTV cameras then how can any victim of crime hope that this police will care themoutside of the airport where there are no CCTV cameras?
@RafaCatalaPolo @Turespana_ The "CCTV recording" of the crime reported:(Police report No. 150800/16) was veryuseful for the public awareness as well as for the investigation and prosecution butpolice and AENA did not save the CCTV recording and deleted it quickly instead ofwaiting for the 30-DAYs of time
@RafaCatalaPolo @Turespana_ Why Spanish police play dishonest games with the victim of crime by using the loopholes in the system, instead of helping them in practical ways?
@RafaCatalaPolo @Turespana_ Tourism in Spain is the 3rd major contributor to the national economic life thenwhy the Spanish police have hidden policy to ignore the "victim of crime, tourists"?
@pbustinduy Yes, it's always easy to blame Israel, mister. Your address is the Hamas terror regime, for some reason you're afraid to confront them. I wonder why?
@marianorajoy You usurp the rule of Law and you abuse children of God in Catalonia, your actions must be answered for, we all belong to God and yet you abuse, ridicule and attack in every inhuman way the people of Catalonia, their family's and loved ones, that is Evil. Free them.
@marianorajoy You are committing a Criminal offence by preventing Democratically Elected Politicians from attending the Parliament in Catalonia, release the men you are holding illegally, you will be brought to justice, by external forces outside of Spain, and will go to court.
@zoidoJI @policia On social media the "Biased &amp; Racist" comments made me believe strongly that at Valencia airport when I was begging for the SOS help the police ignored to help me because of our RACE (colour of skin). Treated us like criminals because we were not Spanish

We have a serious problem in Spain with justice. There is not yet a real separation of powers. Judges appointed by politicians who can not act completely independently. An advanced society needs real and effective justice.

@KRLS We do not respect the way how Israel has occupied, violated and killed Palestinian people. We'll never accept any apartheid or colonialist State. It  is a shame to congratulate this racist, zionist and killer State of Israel. It must be condemned and sanctioned
@KRLS It's not "self-sacrifice" but the genocide sacrifice of the Palestinian people that Israel systematically perpetrates today. Regrettable and opportunistic realpolitik of @ KRLS ...this is what you want a State for?
@KRLS I am disgusted that you support the Israeli occupation andgenocide of the Palestine People while demanding that Spain stop occupying Catalonia.@hypocrite
@KRLS Really? You support a state that‚Äôs murdering men women and children on a daily basis, that steals and robs other people‚Äôs lands? I had so much respect for you, now that‚Äôs totally gone.

@XavierDomenechs I find this logic captivating, you realize you are arguing for accepting that a judge in Madrid without legal basis can limit the fundamental rights of an elected member of the Catalan parliament, keep this person from attending an investiture session, and your logic says: OK.
@Albert_Rivera if Catalonia is your land, when do you plan to publicly apologize to the teachers you unjustly vilified publishing their pictures and calling them "separatists" and "cowards"?
@Albert_Rivera Constitution is only valid if real national identity (unity of people based on their free will) exists. If an autonomous community don't have it and want a peaceful separation, I see no problem. To me, forcing indissoluble unity of nation is un-democratic and should be abolished.
